/**
 * 421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array
 *
 * Given a non-empty array of numbers, a0, a1, a2, … , an-1, where 0 ≤ ai < 231.
 * Find the maximum result of ai XOR aj, where 0 ≤ i, j < n.
 * Could you do this in O(n) runtime?
 *
 * This algorithm's idea is:
 * to iteratively determine what would be each bit of the final result from left to right.
 * And it narrows down the candidate group iteration by iteration.
 * e.g. assume input are a,b,c,d,...z, 26 integers in total.
 * In first iteration, if you found that a, d, e, h, u differs on the MSB(most significant bit),
 * so you are sure your final result's MSB is set.
 *
 * Now in second iteration, you try to see if among a, d, e, h, u
 * there are at least two numbers make the 2nd MSB differs,
 * if yes, then definitely, the 2nd MSB will be set in the final result.
 *
 * And maybe at this point the candidate group shinks from a,d,e,h,u to a, e, h.
 * Implicitly, every iteration, you are narrowing down the candidate group,
 * but you don't need to track how the group is shrinking,
 * you only cares about the final result.
 *
 * example: Given [14, 11, 7, 2], which in binary are [1110, 1011, 0111, 0010].
 * Since the MSB is 3, I'll start from i = 3 to make it simplify.
 * i = 3, set = {1000, 0000}, max = 1000
 * i = 2, set = {1100, 1000, 0100, 0000}, max = 1100
 * i = 1, set = {1110, 1010, 0110, 0010}, max = 1100
 * i = 0, set = {1110, 1011, 0111, 0010}, max = 1100
 * The mask is 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111.
