/**
 * 684. Redundant Connection
 *
 * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
 *
 * The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N),
 * with one additional edge added.
 *
 * The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N,
 * and was not an edge that already existed.
 *
 * The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges.
 * Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v,
 * that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.
 *
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes.
 * If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.
 * The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.
